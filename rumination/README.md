## Description

`mikenakis-rumination` is a Java Agent and associated class library that modifies the bytecode
of appropriately annotated java classes to ensure that certain so-called _ruminator_ method of the class gets
invoked whenever the state of the object is changed by one of its setters.
The ruminator method receives the name of the field that was changed. (Since java does not support field literals.)

## Coding style

When I write code as part of a team of developers, I use the teams' coding style.  
But when I write code for myself, I use _**my very ownâ„¢**_ coding style.
