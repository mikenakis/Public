## Description

`mikenakis-clio` is a Java class library that provides command-line argument parsing for console applications.
It aims to be very simple and easy to use.

The purpose of mikenakis-clio is to strike a fine balance between number of features (reasonably many) and
simplicity of interface (easy and intuitive, so you do not need to learn an argument-parsing framework in
order to have your arguments parsed.)

You can see how it is used in the following projects:

- my [mikenakis-classdump project](https://github.com/mikenakis/mikenakis-classdump)
- my [mikenakis-testana project](https://github.com/mikenakis/mikenakis-testana)

## Coding style

When I write code as part of a team of developers, I use the teams' coding style.  
But when I write code for myself, I use _**my very ownâ„¢**_ coding style.
