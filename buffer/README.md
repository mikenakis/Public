## Description
                                                                                                                  
A java library which provides class `Buffer` and a few surrogates.

A `Buffer` encapsulates an immutable array of bytes.

A `Buffer` can be thought of as the equivalent of `java.lang.String`, but for bytes instead of characters. 

A `Buffer` can also be thought of as an "ANSI String". (A string of ANSI characters instead of Unicode characters.)

Surrogates provided:
 - `BufferBuilder`, which is the equivalent of `java.lang.StringBuilder`
 - `BufferBuilderOutputStream` which roughly corresponds to `java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream`.
 - etc.
