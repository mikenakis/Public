This package contains a signature parser.

Code in this package was "inspired" from classes sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser
and sun.reflect.generics.tree.*

It is yet to be incorporated into the bytecode module.

In order to incorporate it, the following must be done:

- Tests must be added to make sure it all works.
- In addition to parsing, I must also add printing.
