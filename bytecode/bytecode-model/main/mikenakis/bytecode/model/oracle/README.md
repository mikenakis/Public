Code in this package was "inspired" from package sun.reflect.generics.tree

This package contains a signature parser.

It is yet to be incorporated into the bytecode module.

In order to incorporate it, the following must be done:

- Tests must be added to make sure it all works.
- It needs to be converted to work with Buffer instead of String.
- In addition to reading (parsing,) I must also add writing and printing.
