/**
 * Signifies that an invariable field is mutable because it is an array field, and it has not been annotated with @{@link InvariableArray}. (So each array
 * element is still variable, regardless of the immutability assessment of the element itself.)
 * <p>
 * Note: we could turn this into a provisory assessment because the array may still turn out to be immutable if it is of zero length, (if the array has no
 * elements, then there are no elements to vary,) but this would complicate things, and it would not help much, because it would not save us from having to
 * perform runtime checks, because we would still have to discover that the array has zero elements.
