/**
 * Signifies that a class is provisory because it is composite, with components whose immutability will need to be assessed.
 * <p>
 * This is used for classes that are not iterable but contain elements, i.e. implementations of {@link java.util.Map}, which is conceptually a collection of
 * entries, but does not extend {@link java.util.Collection<java.util.Map.Entry>} and instead offers an {@link java.util.Map#entrySet()} method.
 * <p>
 * If the mode is {@link TypeAssessment.Mode#Assessed} then the class has been assessed to be immutable in all other respects.
 * <p>
 * If the mode is {@link TypeAssessment.Mode#Preassessed} then this assessment overrules an assessment that would normally come out as mutable, and promises
 * that this class will behave as immutable, with the caveat that it is iterable.
