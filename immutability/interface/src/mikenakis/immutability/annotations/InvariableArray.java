/**
 * Represents a promise that the elements of an array, which are non-final by nature, can be considered as final, so that the declaring class can be assessed as
 * immutable if it meets all other requirements for immutability.
 * <p>
 * This is essentially a promise that the array will be used in such a way that will not affect the immutability of the declaring class, for example:
 * <p>
 * - Array elements will be initialized in the constructor of the declaring class and will never be written again once the constructor returns.
 * <p>
 * - Array elements may be written by methods other than the constructor, but each element will be written at most once, and will never be read before it is
 * written.
 * <p>
 * - Array elements may be written multiple times, but in a thread-safe way, and they do not participate in the hashCode computation.
 * <p>
 * For example, in an alternative implementation of class {@link String} the array of characters would be marked with this annotation, thus allowing the string
 * class to be assessed as immutable.
 * <p>
 * Note that this annotation only makes sense on array fields that are {@code private} and are either {@code final} or annotated with {@link Invariable}.
 * <p>
 * Note that if an array is marked as {@link InvariableArray}, this only promises shallow immutability; therefore, the immutability of each array element will
 * be assessed before the array can be considered deeply immutable.
 * <p>
 * Also see jdk.internal.vm.annotation.Stable which gives a similar promise but for slightly different purposes. (Strangely enough, in {@link java.lang.String}
 * even though the character array is marked with jdk.internal.vm.annotation.Stable, the cached hashcode is not; I do not know why.)
 * <p>
 * TODO: add an integer parameter indicating the number of dimensions for which invariability is promised, so that we can declare an invariable array of
 * invariable arrays, etc.
