# mikenakis-dispatch
#### Event dispatching.

## Description

`mikenakis-dispatch` is a Java class library for building event-driven systems.

Two implementations are provided:

 - The `fake` implementation, which is useful for testing event-driven software.
 - The `autonomous` implementation, which allows building stand-alone (autonomous) event-driven systems.

It is fairly easy to create implementations that encapsulate the message pumps of other existing
event-driven systems, for example the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) of AWT/Swing.
